# Pokemon Database Web App

Welcome to the Pokemon Database Web App repository! This project showcases my skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the integration of external APIs. In this web app, users can explore a list of Pokemon, filter them by type, and view detailed information about each Pokemon.

- **Filtering**: Filter Pokemon by type using the navigation bar.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find Pokemon by name or type.
- **Details Modal**: View detailed information about a selected Pokemon.
- **Loading Screen**: A loading screen is displayed while data is being fetched.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to work seamlessly on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for interactive and dynamic features.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for a responsive and consistent design.
- **Fetch API**: Used to make asynchronous requests to the Pokemon API.
- **Promises**: Handling asynchronous operations for a smoother user experience.
